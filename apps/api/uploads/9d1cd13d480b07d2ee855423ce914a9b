# Reference Website Analysis (blog.tomys.top)

## Overview
The website appears to be a personal blog, featuring articles on various topics. It has a clean interface with a left-hand navigation menu (on PC) and a mobile-friendly layout.

## Key Features Observed:
- **Blog Posts:** Displays articles with titles, and potentially categories/tags.
- **Navigation:** Appears to have categories, pages, and an "About Me" section.
- **Search Functionality:** Indicated by a search icon.
- **Content Structure:** Articles seem to be primarily text-based, possibly with embedded images or other media.
- **Responsive Design:** Mentioned in the markdown content for PC and mobile.

## Technical Considerations (Initial Thoughts):
- **Frontend:** Likely uses a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) or a static site generator for the main blog, given the dynamic elements and responsive design.
- **Backend:** A RESTful API or GraphQL API would be used to serve blog post content, categories, and other data to the frontend.
- **Database:** A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) would store blog posts, user information (for admin), categories, tags, etc.
- **Admin Panel:** A separate interface for managing blog posts, categories, and other site settings.
- **Content Management:** The request mentions "content can be configured," suggesting a CMS-like approach for easy replication.

## Next Steps:
- Further explore the website to understand specific features like comments, user authentication (for admin), and content types.
- Investigate how content is structured and delivered (e.g., API endpoints).
- Based on the analysis, propose a detailed technical stack and architecture.



## Content Organization:
- **Categories:** The blog utilizes categories to organize posts, as evidenced by the '所有分类' (All Categories) link and the display of categories like '实用软件' (Utility Software), '原创' (Original), '原神' (Genshin Impact), '游戏' (Games), '逼逼' (Bibi), and '闲聊' (Chat).
- **Tags:** There are also tags, indicated by '17 标签' (17 Tags), suggesting a tagging system for more granular content classification.
- **Post Details:** Each post seems to have a title, date, view count, and possibly comments/likes.

## API Structure (Hypothesis):
Based on the content organization, the API would likely expose endpoints for:
- Retrieving a list of all categories.
- Retrieving a list of all tags.
- Retrieving posts by category or tag.
- Retrieving individual post details.
- Potentially, endpoints for search functionality.

## Further Investigation:
- Look for any explicit API documentation or network requests in the browser's developer tools to confirm API structure.
- Analyze the URL patterns for posts and categories to infer routing and data retrieval mechanisms.



## Inferred API Structure and Technical Stack:

### API Endpoints (Hypothetical):
- `/api/posts`: GET for all posts, POST for creating new posts (admin).
- `/api/posts/{id}`: GET for a single post, PUT/DELETE for updating/deleting posts (admin).
- `/api/categories`: GET for all categories, POST for creating new categories (admin).
- `/api/categories/{id}`: GET for a single category, PUT/DELETE for updating/deleting categories (admin).
- `/api/tags`: GET for all tags, POST for creating new tags (admin).
- `/api/tags/{id}`: GET for a single tag, PUT/DELETE for updating/deleting tags (admin).
- `/api/comments`: GET for all comments, POST for creating new comments.
- `/api/comments/{id}`: PUT/DELETE for updating/deleting comments (admin).
- `/api/search?query=...`: GET for searching posts.

### Proposed Technical Stack:
- **Frontend (Blog & Admin):** React.js (or Vue.js) for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend (API):** Python with Flask (or FastAPI) for a lightweight and efficient RESTful API.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or MySQL) for robust data storage.
- **Content Management:** The content will be stored in the database and managed via the admin panel, allowing for easy replication and configuration.

## Conclusion of Phase 1:
I have analyzed the reference website and formulated a technical plan for the blog project. The next phase will involve designing the database structure and API interfaces in detail.
